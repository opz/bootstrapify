# Bootstrapify 3.1.0

Bootstrapify is an open-source base theme for [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com?ref=lucid-design) that makes it super quick and easy for developers to start building amazing, responsive themes without having to do all the fiddly, repetitive setup work when starting from scratch.

You can view the Bootstrapify theme at http://bootstrapify-theme.myshopify.com.

##Modified to use LESS instead of SASS


## Getting started

Clone Bootstrapify using git or download the [zip file](https://github.com/luciddesign/bootstrapify/archive/master.zip).

    git clone git@github.com:luciddesign/bootstrapify.git

### Simple setup

If you wish to use the theme without touching the SASS or Bootstrap files then just remove everything except the theme folder. Create a zipped file of the theme folder and upload this to Shopify.

### Advanced setup

If you wish to develop locally and push your changes to Shopify you will need to use [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com/) and the [Shopify Theme gem](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_theme).

#### Workflow

There is one caveat with using SCSS with Shopify: They don't support `@import`... yet.
So to keep Bootstrap intact and updateable we have created a workflow for working with this theme.

Styles.scss is kept outside the theme directory and is compiled using Grunt into `assets/_base.css`.

We use the [Shopify Theme gem](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_theme) to watch the theme directory and push any changes up to Shopify.

#### Requirements

You will need to install both [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
The Shopify theme gem and SASS require Ruby. Grunt.js and Bower use Node.js. Once these are installed you can setup the project.

#### Installation

If you havent installed Grunt and Bower globally on your system already install them using npm:

    npm install -g bower

    npm install -g grunt-cli

Install Grunts dependancies:

    npm install

Install Bootstrap and other Bower dependancies:

    bower install

Install the SASS gem and the Shopify theme gem:

    bundle install

#### Setup the Shopify theme gem

Inside the theme folder run:

    theme configure [api_key] [password] [store_url]
    
More detail can be found on the [Shopify theme gems readme](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_theme#usage)

#### Build

To build the project run:

    grunt    

This will do the following:

 * Compile the SCSS files into the themes asset directory.
 * Copy Bootstraps JS files into the themes asset directory.
 * Lint the Bootstrapify JS files.

To compile the SCSS files automaticly when they are saved run:

    grunt watch
